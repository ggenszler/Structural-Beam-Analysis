# Structural-Beam-Analysis
Solves reaction forces of determinate and indeterminate beams, graph internal shear and moment diagrams, and compute deflections.

beam_calcs.m: main script
indet.m: function that solves for degrees of static indeterminacy
statics.m: function solves the reaction forces for a simply supported beam
shearmoment.m: function that solves for the internal shear and moment along the beam and graphs the two with counter clockwise on the positive side of the beam
displacement.m: solves the displacement at a given distance along the beam
